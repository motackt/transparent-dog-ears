# Transparent Dog Ears
The traditional CSS3 method of creating dog-ears on containers relies on a solid background behind the post, otherwise the illusion is ruined. This isn't great if you want a gradient or image background. This method of dog-ear will circumvent that. I'm not sure if anyone else has figured out how to make a dog-ear the way I have here, but I was stumped 4 months ago on how to achieve this as there didn't appear to be any answers. Hopefully, this will help someone out!

There are two CSS files here, but they do the same thing. One utilises variables, and the other doesn't.

Feel free to use anywhere! I just ask you credit my profile page here ^__^
