# Transparent Dog Ears
The traditional CSS3 method of creating dog-ears on containers relies on a solid background behind the post, otherwise the illusion is ruined. This isn't great if you want a gradient or image background. This method of dog-ear will circumvent that. I'm not sure if anyone else has figured out how to make a dog-ear the way I have here, but I was stumped 4 months ago on how to achieve this as there didn't appear to be any answers. Hopefully, this will help someone out!

There are three methods in the dog-ear CSS, each has their advantages and disadvantages that can be seen when you put everything in a code-pen or otherwise!

Feel free to use anywhere! I just ask you credit my profile page in the source code ^__^
